# Elements of Telecom Network

Every Mobile Network has almost the same elements:

* **UE**: User Equipment
* **eNB**: Evolved Node B
* **RAN**: Radio Access Network

## User Equipment

In 4G every User Equipment has it's own SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) that allows to connect with the network.

## Evolved Node B

> Each **eNB** is a base station that controls the mobiles in one or more cells. - _An Introduction to LTE_

The *eNB* has two main functions. Firstly, the **eNB** sends radio transmissions to all its mobiles on the downlink and receives transmissions from them on the uplink, using the analogue and digital processing functions of LTE air interface. Secondly, the **eNB** controls the low-level operation of its mobiles, by sending them signalling messages such as handover commands that relate to those ration transmissions. 

## Radio Access Network

The **UE** connects with a eNB

On Telecom, we have two layers the RAN and the Core Network. THE RAN, Radio Access Network, is
